Learning classes in python

The Classes.py file contains 3 classes that are used to instantiate a "mechanical tram", an "electric tram" and a "battery" for an electric tram. This file uses the technique of class inheritance and overriding the methods of the parent class. Example: the ElecricalTramvai class inherits from the Tramvai class, and the get_count_gas method in the Tramvai class displays the volume of the fuel tank in the console, unlike the same method in the ElectricalTramvai class, where it says that there is no fuel tank in the electric tram.
